        Our story began when Amelita G. Laserna emigrated to the United States in 1980 with a passion for sharing the comforting flavors of Filipino cuisine. She opened a small restaurant in Jersey City, NJ, which quickly became a beloved community favorite. Over the years, our family-run business has grown into a trusted name in the Filipino food industry, now led by Amelita’s children, who continue to honor her dedication to authenticity and excellence.
